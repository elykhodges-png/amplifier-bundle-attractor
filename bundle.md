    Attractor coding agent and pipeline framework for Amplifier.
    Implements the StrongDM Attractor nlspec — a non-interactive coding agent
    structured as a graph of phases, sufficient for use in a Software Factory.

    Entry points:
      bundles/attractor-pipeline  — Multi-provider pipeline (route nodes to
                                    Anthropic, OpenAI, or Gemini via model stylesheet)
      bundles/attractor-agent     — Standalone coding agent (defaults to Anthropic)
      profiles/*                  — Provider-specific single-agent profiles

includes:
  - bundle: git+https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier-foundation@main
  - bundle: attractor:behaviors/attractor-core

# Attractor

A non-interactive coding agent and pipeline framework built on Amplifier.

## Entry Points

### Multi-Provider Pipeline (`bundles/attractor-pipeline`)

The **primary entry point** for running Attractor pipelines. Wires all three
providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini) so the DOT graph's model stylesheet can
route different nodes to different providers.

```yaml
includes:
  - bundle: attractor:bundles/attractor-pipeline
```

Provide a DOT graph via orchestrator config:

```yaml
session:
  orchestrator:
    config:
      dot_file: ./my-pipeline.dot
```

See `examples/pipelines/06-model-stylesheet.dot` for a multi-provider pipeline
example using CSS-like selectors to assign models per node.

### Standalone Coding Agent (`bundles/attractor-agent`)

A simpler entry point for using Attractor as a single coding agent (no
pipeline). Defaults to Anthropic but the user can override via
`provider_preferences` at the CLI.

```yaml
includes:
  - bundle: attractor:bundles/attractor-agent
```

Includes `amplifier-foundation` so it works standalone.

### Provider-Specific Profiles (`profiles/`)

Individual single-agent profiles for when you want a specific provider with
its aligned tool configuration:

- `attractor:profiles/attractor-profile-anthropic` — Anthropic (Claude Code aligned, edit_file)
- `attractor:profiles/attractor-profile-openai` — OpenAI (codex-rs aligned, apply_patch)
- `attractor:profiles/attractor-profile-gemini` — Gemini (gemini-cli aligned, web tools)

```yaml
includes:
  - bundle: attractor:profiles/attractor-profile-anthropic
```
